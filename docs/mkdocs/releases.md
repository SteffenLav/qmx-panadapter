## Latest Release

**v1.3.3** — 2026-07-29

Your transmit frequency is finally visible and under your control, the Tab5 stops calling stations that are busy with someone else, and there is a volume control for QMX+ builds with no control panel. Almost all of this came from Roy KI0ER's field reports.

- **See and change your TX audio frequency.** The Tab5 used to pick your transmit tone silently and never tell you what it chose, so you could neither tell whether you were sitting on top of someone nor get out of the way. The tone now appears on its own line in the TX status block, and the `FREQ BUSY` warning names the frequency. A new **TX nnnn Hz** button next to "Active: N" opens a picker: a **live occupancy strip** across the whole 200-2800 Hz window (green free, red busy, amber you, cyan your partner), **touch and drag** to choose a slot, ±50 Hz nudges, a **Find clear slot** button, the free slots listed as numbers, and a plain-words verdict on whether your choice is clear. It applies **between** bursts and refuses while one is on the air — changeable mid-QSO, exactly as WSJT-X allows, and your partner is unaffected because they track the slot, not the frequency. *The strip shows decoded stations, not raw spectrum: a station too weak to decode will not show as busy, and an all-grey strip means nothing has been heard yet.*
- **It no longer calls a station that is working someone else.** On a busy band several people answer the same CQ and the caller picks one. When that was not you, the Tab5 kept transmitting anyway — six full-power bursts at a station whose own decode row showed it mid-exchange with somebody else — then gave up. Now it waits while their last message is addressed to a third party, and resumes the moment they send `73`/`RR73` or call CQ again. The bigger win is that giving up used to **grey-list** the station after two attempts, so a perfectly audible station could be permanently skipped for no reason other than being popular. A wait is not a failed attempt. Capped at about six minutes so a station that vanishes still times out.
- **An incoming `RRR` now finishes the QSO.** `RRR` is the older form of `RR73` and means the same thing, but it was not recognised — so Roy and NH6L deadlocked, NH6L sending `KI0ER NH6L RRR` every slot and the Tab5 answering with the same report every slot until Roy stepped in by hand.
- **QMX volume from the Tab5** (Randy N4OPI). Randy's QMX+ has no control panel, so no volume knob at all. There is now a **QMX volume** slider in the settings drawer, under Flip 180, in both modes. The value is **in decibels — the same number the radio shows on its own LCD**, not an invented percentage, and it reads the rig back each time the drawer opens so the two never disagree if you use the radio's knob.
- **LoTW uploads now carry US state and county.** They were not being sent at all, which meant US operators' QSOs earned **no Worked All States and no county credit** — for them or for the stations they worked. Two new fields in the LoTW setup page; the county is the name on its own (`Arlington`), not `VA,Arlington`. Adding them does **not** re-upload your log: the upload position now only resets when the certificate itself changes. Found by cross-checking against Paul N8HM's CardSat project, and verified against a worked example from a QSO LoTW actually accepted. Operators outside the US are unaffected.
- **Smaller fixes.** The "decode my partner's reply first" optimisation had been aimed at *our own* transmit tone instead of the partner's ever since v0.18.4, so it never did anything — a pounce deliberately transmits away from the station being called, measured here as 250 and 750 Hz off on two test QSOs. The decode list is cleared when you leave **simulation mode** (phantom stations no longer linger in a list meant to be real, still tappable) and when you switch **FT8↔FT4** (different slot lengths, so the old rows describe a band the new mode cannot hear). The **practice simulator was silently broken** with "Fast pounce" off — the default — with phantom stations never replying at all, because a reply was scheduled one second later than the retry that reset it and lost that race every slot. LoTW upload success detection now matches TQSL's own test exactly.

### Installing v1.3.3

1. Use the one-click flasher from the [Releases page](https://github.com/SteffenLav/qmx-panadapter/releases)
2. Or follow [Build from Source](build/build.md)

Your settings are preserved during a normal flash.

!!! note "Not yet verified on hardware"
    The **QMX volume slider has not been tested against a radio** — no QMX was attached while it was written. The **tone picker** and the **busy-station hold** were verified against the practice simulator, which is nothing like a real crowded band. The **LoTW state/county** path needs a US callsign certificate to exercise, so it is written to treat those fields as optional and never required. Reports on any of these are welcome.

## Previous Releases

**v1.3.2** — 2026-07-26 — Grid squares are logged again (almost every QSO was missing `GRIDSQUARE` — John W5JSS), **PSK Reporter spotting** on by default (**since confirmed working**: "QMX Panadapter v1.3.2" is listed under "Software in use" at pskreporter.info with spots from six stations — note the 5½-minute delay before the first report, and that PSK Reporter never acknowledges anything, so that page is the only place to check), the **User Manual built into the firmware** so it needs no WiFi and no SD card and the "Save offline" button is gone, an explicit **microSD backup contract** (continuous with WiFi off and a green dot; one complete backup per start-up with WiFi on and a yellow dot — insert the card *before* switching on), **grey-listing** for stations that never answer (opt-in), and **pileup replies** using the intelligent-Transmit laddering (both Roy KI0ER).

**v1.3.1** — 2026-07-24 — Two decode-list columns requested by Roy KI0ER (**DT**, the station's slot-timing offset, and **HZ**, its audio tone, with the country column compacted to a 3-letter code), a boot-diagnostics fix so ST7121 units report the hardware actually detected (Paul VE3PIK), and UI alignment polish (QMX prompt placement, FT8 left-pane grid, settings-drawer dropdowns and sliders).

**v1.3.0** — 2026-07-23

Smarter manual FT8 operation — built around field feedback from **Roy KI0ER** — plus a rebuilt practice simulator, USB mouse support, and a web file browser for the microSD card.

- **Intelligent Transmit.** Tapping a decoded station's **Transmit** now sends the correct *next* message for that exchange — their CQ gets your grid (or your report with Skip-TX1 on), their grid gets your report, their report gets your roger, and so on — the same behaviour as a WSJT-X double-click. You can run a whole QSO by hand, one tap per step, and it **logs to ADIF** like any other contact when you send the closing RR73/73.
- **Faster replies.** The mid-slot reply window is wider and hand-armed exchanges now land on the beat instead of a cycle late. A subtle bug that made every exchange step transmit twice in some cases is fixed.
- **Fast pounce (early decode) — new toggle, on by default.** Decodes appear *before* the slot boundary (the way WSJT-X works), so answering a fresh CQ can transmit in the very next slot instead of waiting 30 s. ⚠️ *Honest note: this specific feature hasn't been verified on a live band yet (no antenna at the development QTH until mid-August). The known trade-off is that a station transmitting late in the slot can occasionally be missed. If your decode counts drop with it on, switch it off in the FT8 settings drawer — and please report your before/after numbers on the groups.io thread; that's exactly the field data we need.*
- **Pileup no longer hides the log.** While callers are waiting the ADIF-log button reads "Pileup" — **holding it now always opens the ADIF log** (a one-time hint teaches the gesture). **Auto-work pileup** also starts draining immediately when you enable it with callers already waiting, and worked-before stations only vanish from the pileup when you've actually checked "Exclude worked-before".
- **Practice simulator, rebuilt.** FT8 Simulation Mode now needs **no radio at all** — six phantom stations (US + DX) call CQ, four of them answer your CQ at once (a real pileup to practice on), and they're patient like real operators: each repeats its message up to four times before giving up. They answer manual step-by-step Transmit, Auto Pounce, and CQ-runs alike. When you're done, a **"Del N test"** button in the ADIF viewer (only visible while practice contacts exist) wipes them from the log in two taps.
- **USB mouse.** Plug a mouse into the USB-A port — a cursor appears and clicks drive everything. *(Limitation: the mouse and QMX can't share the port, and a USB hub can't bridge them on this hardware — so it's for setup, log review and manual reading with the radio unplugged.)*
- **microSD file browser.** **Files → SD Files** in the web page opens a browser for the card — download logs and backups, upload, delete — without pulling the card out.
- **User Manual on a fresh boot** now waits for WiFi instead of asking for a reboot.

**v1.2.0** — 2026-07-20 — A built-in **User Manual on the Tab5 itself** (Settings drawer → User Manual): native markdown reader with a drag-to-pick two-column Contents page, offline copies to microSD (**Save offline**), and a quiet GitHub firmware-update check. *(The Save-offline mechanism was superseded in v1.3.2 — the manual now ships inside the firmware.)* Plus the FT8 pileup fix: a worked (or late-answering) station no longer lingers in the pileup. *(Thanks to Dirk DK7CVD.)*

**v1.1.0** — 2026-07-19 — A years-old FT8 decode mystery solved: the panadapter used to hear 60+ stations in its first slots then collapse to a fraction; the cause was ~200–350 ms of QMX audio lost at the USB wire every slot (invisible to every counter). Fixed — full decode rate every slot now. Plus the microSD card promoted to a full grab-and-go station backup (QSO log + settings + LoTW cert/key), automatic GPS time sync (~10 ms, no toggle), a band-plan drag from the bottom bar, and an ADIF-viewer crash fix.

**v1.0.1** — 2026-07-17 — Point fix: when you answer a CQ, the report you send back is your own measurement of their signal, not an echo of theirs. (Reported by Steve N0SZ, Jonathan KN6LFB.)

### v1.0.0 — 2026-07-16

**The 1.0.** The beta label is gone: the QMX Panadapter is a complete, self-contained FT8/FT4 station — receive, transmit, auto-QSO, logging, and upload to **all three major logbooks** — with no PC anywhere in the loop.

- **LoTW upload — the final piece.** QSOs are signed on the device with your own ARRL callsign certificate and uploaded directly to Logbook of the World. One-time guided setup from the web page (step-by-step TQSL certificate export, then import — your certificate passphrase never leaves your browser). Live-verified against lotw.arrl.org. Certificate renewal: Ctrl-click the LoTW button
- **The FT8 "everything sent twice" behaviour is fixed.** Replies used to miss their own slot by ~2 seconds and go out again next cycle, doubling QSO duration; the transmitter now holds ~2 seconds for the fresh reply and fires it on the same slot. Field-verified on air
- **Nonstandard callsigns work now**: special/compound calls (special-event stations, `PJ4/...`) no longer show as `<...>` once heard in full, and their answers to your CQ are recognized
- **Correct received reports in the log**: the partner's `R-06`-style roger is their real measurement of your signal and is now logged as such — no more 599 placeholders from CQ runs. (Old 599 rows can be deleted — see next)
- **QSO log viewer grows up**: a Today/All filter with a **POTA activation counter** (title turns green at 10 QSOs today), and **single-record delete** — long-press a row, drag to the right line, release, confirm. Deletions keep all three logbook upload positions consistent
- **Broken QSOs resume**: if a station fades mid-exchange and comes back within a few minutes, the exchange continues where it stopped (automatically, or by tapping their row) instead of restarting from scratch
- **Steadier decode list during CQ runs**: stations you can't currently hear (they transmit when you do) no longer vanish mid-run, and the list keeps entries for 2 minutes instead of 1
- **Display sleep**: set an idle timeout and the screen turns off while everything keeps running (FT8, radio link, web UI). Tap to wake — the wake tap can't press anything. Two-finger double-tap blanks immediately. A real battery win for unattended and web-only use
- **Reorganized settings drawer**: setup items (WiFi, callsign, band-plan region, brightness, battery care, display sleep) grouped at the top, display-tuning controls below
- **Web page polish**: the bottom bar's many buttons are now three tidy menus (QSO Logs / Files / Miscellaneous); a congested WiFi link can no longer freeze the page for seconds
- **A rare crash fixed**: a momentary USB glitch on the radio-control link could reboot the whole device; it now just retries
- Full writeup in [Version History Document](https://github.com/SteffenLav/qmx-panadapter/blob/main/docs/version-history.md)

### v0.21.0

- **FT4 returned** — the panadapter no longer redraws itself behind the FT8/FT4 screen, freeing the processor headroom FT4's 7.5-second cadence needs; verified end-to-end (RX + TX)
- Fixed a full-screen display flash (mostly in FT4); QRZ upload no longer gets stuck on already-logged contacts; reset settings or Wi-Fi from the web page; QMX VOX switched off automatically at link time

### v0.20.1 / v0.20.0

- **Robustness release.** WiFi "dies after a few minutes" fault now self-heals instead of needing a reboot; opening a window no longer freezes the device; the radio-control (CAT) link rides out USB glitches; the web UI pauses its stream while FT8 runs
- FT8 decode timing anchored to the exact slot boundary; FT8 pile-up list + "Skip TX1" quick pounce; 11 m/CB band; memory-channel overhaul; battery-care charge limit; web-UI whole-band plan strip, draggable split, better screenshots and keypad
- microSD now on its own bus (SD auto-archive still off — it squeezed memory needed by FT8)
- v0.20.1 hot-fix: fixed a reboot on every pounce (a scratch table overflowed a small task stack; moved to PSRAM)
- *(FT4 was switched off across v0.20.x for the memory pressure now resolved in v0.21.0.)*

### v0.19.5

- AM mode + Antenna Tune for QMX 1_04+ firmware (invisible on stable 1_03_002)
- Fixed a crash on leaving FT8 mode; WiFi on/off now applies live and no longer wipes a saved password; FT8/FT4 remembers its own frequency
- Band picker shows all bands in two columns; band-plan strip is a see-through framed window with 6 m segments; steadier point-to-tune; settings-drawer slider/scroll fixes; DiGi-gated memory recall in FT8/FT4

### v0.19.4

- FT4 usability — four stacked faults fixed: a capture buffer's FFT workspace in slow memory (every other slot decoded nothing), a mis-firing stuck-decoder watchdog wiping the list mid-QSO, an uncapped per-slot clock nudge, and slot-parity computed on FT8's grid in FT4
- QMX IQ-mode confirmation hardened (readback no longer fooled by the command echo)
- See-through frequency keypad; settings-drawer declutter (removed Snap-to-signal + FT8 sync lines, moved Band-plan region)

### v0.19.3

- QMX IQ-mode handshake retried automatically (up to 4 attempts), with a red on-screen banner if all attempts fail — a silent failure could leave a whole session without I/Q data (spectrum shifted, tunable across the full 48 kHz window)
- Band-plan strip: tracks zoom/pan live, shows the filter passband at band scale, drag-to-tune and tap-to-jump directly on the strip
- Memory channel drag-to-move; tap an empty slot to create; out-of-band frequencies rejected immediately
- Frequency entry popup: draggable, resizable (pinch/swipe), position remembered across reboots
- ADIF log viewer rebuilt: real column alignment, sticky header, Country and Mode columns, Sent/Rcvd split, zebra rows
- FT8/FT4 TX confirm dialog: up/down nudge buttons; FT4 countdown and title corrected for 7.5-second slots
- FT4 clock-sync fix (timing offset was using FT8's block geometry, ~3.3× wrong) and FT4 decode-quality fix (FT8's iteration cut no longer applied to FT4)
- QRZ/eQSL uploads more reliable (SD auto-archive paused during uploads); web UI stale-connection freeze capped at 5 s

### v0.19.2

- microSD auto-archive: diagnostic log, ADIF log, and a config export are mirrored automatically to a microSD card when one is inserted
- Diagnostic log is now always-on and survives a power loss (a rolling copy persists to internal flash, downloadable even with no SD card)
- USB reconnect fix: power-cycling the QMX after WiFi is up no longer breaks audio/CAT
- Crash fix: a USB disconnect race that could reboot the Tab5 when the QMX dropped off USB
- QMX IQ mode is now verified, not assumed — the panadapter checks the radio actually accepted the I/Q-mode command instead of just checking the USB write succeeded
- FT8 continuation messages (report, RR73, 73) resend less often during an active QSO — decode time on busy slots cut by ~25-30%

### v0.19.1

- New project homepage at [tab5.lav.dk](https://tab5.lav.dk) — the user guide and reference as plain web pages
- Logbook uploads (QRZ / eQSL) and log downloads now work reliably while FT8 is running — no more reboots or dropped WiFi during a transfer

### v0.19.0

- FT4 transmit and receive (7.5-second slots, 105 symbols, 48 ms cadence) — CAT cadence verified on real QMX hardware
- Per-mode sticky frequency/bandwidth/filter recall between FT8 and FT4

### v0.18.8

- ARRL Field Day FT8 exchange mode (class + section in message, special TX sequence, ADIF logging)
- FT8 simulation mode (practice QSOs with phantom stations, no radio keyed)
- FT8 decode yield investigation closed (found and fixed 3 separate CPU contention issues)

### v0.18.7

- Decode-yield gap **closed** (controlled A/B with v0.18.0 confirmed fixes sufficient)
- Auto-answer robot mode un-shelved (live TX, full disclaimer on-screen)
- CQ tone auto-relocation on clash
- SNTP/QMX time-priority fix + FT8-derived auto-sync
- Flasher recovery mode + auto port detection

### v0.18.6

- FT8 sparse-decode investigation: found 3 separate regressions since v0.18.0
- Fixed: `cw_audio_init()` ghost task, missing poll-task CDC tolerance, waterfall style-set loop
- RST_SENT fix in CQ-run QSO
- Distance-in-miles display toggle
- Diag-log dot + firmware version in bottom bar

### v0.18.5

- Band-aid for FT8 decode regression (incomplete; issue fully addressed in v0.18.6)
- Critical bootloader-corruption hotfix (flasher wrote to 0x0 instead of 0x10000)
- FT8 double-spawn crash guard restored

### v0.18.4

- Band-nav strip (CW/Digi/Phone color zones below frequency axis)
- One-finger pan/stroll (spectrum scroll + center-freq readout)
- Snap-to-signal peak detection
- Band-aware worked-before (callsign + band memory)
- Robot mode (complete but **shelved** — greyed out, disabled)

### v0.18.3

- Waterfall live controls (black level, contrast, adaptive floor, FFT window selector)
- Display 180° flip toggle
- Image rejection investigation (reverted — not a firmware issue)

### v0.18.2

- Idle reboot resolved (WiFi SDIO RX streaming → mempool recycled buffer)
- Web UI freeze/reconnect fix
- BW from web (CW passband)

### v0.18.1

- Config backup/restore (settings + memory channels + ADIF log as INI file)
- Flasher clean-flash option
- Memory recall fix (CAT race condition → optimistic display + deferred writes)
- Fast Panadapter↔FT8 toggle crash fix

### v0.18.0

- FT8 decode rework: streaming STFT + dual-core + reply-on-immediate-slot
- dBm scale restored on spectrum
- Multiple field-reported fixes (memory freq, tap-to-tune reversal, band lockout)

### v0.15.x and Earlier

See [Full Version History](https://github.com/SteffenLav/qmx-panadapter/blob/main/docs/version-history.md) for detailed notes on all earlier releases.

## Roadmap

### Next up (post-v1.0.0)

1. **Web-UI audio streaming** — listen to the receiver in any browser on your LAN, demodulated on the Tab5. Already working in development; held for quality tuning and an overnight streaming soak
2. **CW page** — canned-message CW TX memories, then decoded-CW display
3. **Live microSD mirroring while WiFi is up** — the card and the WiFi co-processor share a DMA controller, so continuous mirroring only works with WiFi off. v1.3.2 made the behaviour explicit and reliable (one complete backup per start-up with WiFi on); making it continuous in both cases needs the underlying bus contention solved

### Phase 6.3 (FPS Recovery)

- Native portrait LVGL rewrite (720×1280, all widgets transposed, canvas drawing ported)
- Avoids 90° software rotation (~50% FPS gain)
- Large effort; not yet started

### Future Additions

- CW audio (shelved since v0.18.5 due to CPU contention; needs pipeline redesign)
- Offline maps (grid squares, distance visualization)
- Video tutorials & regional quick-start guides
