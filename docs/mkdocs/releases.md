## Latest Release

**v0.19.4** — 2026-07-03

This release is almost entirely about making **FT4 actually usable** — four stacked faults, each hiding the next, all fixed. On the bench, FT4 went from "lots of signal, no answers, confusing display" to completing and logging a real QSO.

- **FT4 decode reliability — the big one**: one of the two capture buffers had its FFT workspace land in slow memory, so *every other slot* analysed ~10× too slowly and decoded nothing. FT8's 15-second slots mostly hid it; FT4's 7.5-second slots did not. Both buffers now share one fast-memory workspace — steady decoding on every slot (and more free internal memory as a bonus)
- **"FT8 stuck — resetting audio" no longer fires during normal operation**: a recovery watchdog was mis-triggering on any quiet moment — including mid-QSO — wiping the decode list and timing out otherwise-good contacts; it's now much harder to trigger and never fires while transmitting or mid-QSO
- **Slot clock no longer jumps around in FT4**: the on-air clock nudge is now capped per slot, so genuine drift is still tracked but a single noisy reading can't visibly shift the slot countdown
- **FT4 EVEN/ODD indicator fixed**: slot-parity markers were computed on FT8's 15-second grid, showing E E O O instead of E O E O; all parity indicators now use the active mode's real slot length
- **QMX IQ-mode confirmation hardened**: the readback could be fooled by the QMX's own command echo and report "confirmed" while IQ mode was actually off; it now waits for the echo to clear first
- **Frequency keypad is now see-through** — the live panadapter stays visible behind it while you type
- **Settings drawer tidy-up**: removed the rarely-used **Snap to signal** (taps now always tune exactly where you touch) and **FT8 sync lines** items, and moved **Band-plan region** directly under Callsign & Grid

### Installing v0.19.4

1. Use the one-click flasher from the [Releases page](https://github.com/SteffenLav/qmx-panadapter/releases)
2. Or follow [Build from Source](build/build.md)

### Upgrading from Earlier Versions

Your settings (callsign, grid, WiFi, memory channels) are preserved during a normal flash. If something seems stuck, use a **clean flash** to erase all settings:

1. Run the flasher
2. When prompted, type **E** for clean flash
3. Re-enter your settings on first boot

## Previous Releases

### v0.19.3

- QMX IQ-mode handshake retried automatically (up to 4 attempts), with a red on-screen banner if all attempts fail — a silent failure could leave a whole session without I/Q data (spectrum shifted, tunable across the full 48 kHz window)
- Band-plan strip: tracks zoom/pan live, shows the filter passband at band scale, drag-to-tune and tap-to-jump directly on the strip
- Memory channel drag-to-move; tap an empty slot to create; out-of-band frequencies rejected immediately
- Frequency entry popup: draggable, resizable (pinch/swipe), position remembered across reboots
- ADIF log viewer rebuilt: real column alignment, sticky header, Country and Mode columns, Sent/Rcvd split, zebra rows
- FT8/FT4 TX confirm dialog: up/down nudge buttons; FT4 countdown and title corrected for 7.5-second slots
- FT4 clock-sync fix (timing offset was using FT8's block geometry, ~3.3× wrong) and FT4 decode-quality fix (FT8's iteration cut no longer applied to FT4)
- QRZ/eQSL uploads more reliable (SD auto-archive paused during uploads); web UI stale-connection freeze capped at 5 s

### v0.19.2

- microSD auto-archive: diagnostic log, ADIF log, and a config export are mirrored automatically to a microSD card when one is inserted
- Diagnostic log is now always-on and survives a power loss (a rolling copy persists to internal flash, downloadable even with no SD card)
- USB reconnect fix: power-cycling the QMX after WiFi is up no longer breaks audio/CAT
- Crash fix: a USB disconnect race that could reboot the Tab5 when the QMX dropped off USB
- QMX IQ mode is now verified, not assumed — the panadapter checks the radio actually accepted the I/Q-mode command instead of just checking the USB write succeeded
- FT8 continuation messages (report, RR73, 73) resend less often during an active QSO — decode time on busy slots cut by ~25-30%

### v0.19.1

- New project homepage at [tab5.lav.dk](https://tab5.lav.dk) — the user guide and reference as plain web pages
- Logbook uploads (QRZ / eQSL) and log downloads now work reliably while FT8 is running — no more reboots or dropped WiFi during a transfer

### v0.19.0

- FT4 transmit and receive (7.5-second slots, 105 symbols, 48 ms cadence) — CAT cadence verified on real QMX hardware
- Per-mode sticky frequency/bandwidth/filter recall between FT8 and FT4

### v0.18.8

- ARRL Field Day FT8 exchange mode (class + section in message, special TX sequence, ADIF logging)
- FT8 simulation mode (practice QSOs with phantom stations, no radio keyed)
- FT8 decode yield investigation closed (found and fixed 3 separate CPU contention issues)

### v0.18.7

- Decode-yield gap **closed** (controlled A/B with v0.18.0 confirmed fixes sufficient)
- Auto-answer robot mode un-shelved (live TX, full disclaimer on-screen)
- CQ tone auto-relocation on clash
- SNTP/QMX time-priority fix + FT8-derived auto-sync
- Flasher recovery mode + auto port detection

### v0.18.6

- FT8 sparse-decode investigation: found 3 separate regressions since v0.18.0
- Fixed: `cw_audio_init()` ghost task, missing poll-task CDC tolerance, waterfall style-set loop
- RST_SENT fix in CQ-run QSO
- Distance-in-miles display toggle
- Diag-log dot + firmware version in bottom bar

### v0.18.5

- Band-aid for FT8 decode regression (incomplete; issue fully addressed in v0.18.6)
- Critical bootloader-corruption hotfix (flasher wrote to 0x0 instead of 0x10000)
- FT8 double-spawn crash guard restored

### v0.18.4

- Band-nav strip (CW/Digi/Phone color zones below frequency axis)
- One-finger pan/stroll (spectrum scroll + center-freq readout)
- Snap-to-signal peak detection
- Band-aware worked-before (callsign + band memory)
- Robot mode (complete but **shelved** — greyed out, disabled)

### v0.18.3

- Waterfall live controls (black level, contrast, adaptive floor, FFT window selector)
- Display 180° flip toggle
- Image rejection investigation (reverted — not a firmware issue)

### v0.18.2

- Idle reboot resolved (WiFi SDIO RX streaming → mempool recycled buffer)
- Web UI freeze/reconnect fix
- BW from web (CW passband)

### v0.18.1

- Config backup/restore (settings + memory channels + ADIF log as INI file)
- Flasher clean-flash option
- Memory recall fix (CAT race condition → optimistic display + deferred writes)
- Fast Panadapter↔FT8 toggle crash fix

### v0.18.0

- FT8 decode rework: streaming STFT + dual-core + reply-on-immediate-slot
- dBm scale restored on spectrum
- Multiple field-reported fixes (memory freq, tap-to-tune reversal, band lockout)

### v0.15.x and Earlier

See [Full Version History](https://github.com/SteffenLav/qmx-panadapter/blob/main/docs/version-history.md) for detailed notes on all earlier releases.

## Roadmap

### v1.0.0 (Stable)

Pending:

1. **Multi-hour FT8 TX soak** — confirm no duty-cycle crashes, no over-temp, clean shutdown
2. **LoTW (TQSL) upload** — certificate-based API (harder than QRZ/eQSL)

### Phase 6.3 (FPS Recovery)

- Native portrait LVGL rewrite (720×1280, all widgets transposed, canvas drawing ported)
- Avoids 90° software rotation (~50% FPS gain)
- Large effort; not yet started

### Future Additions

- CW audio (shelved since v0.18.5 due to CPU contention; needs pipeline redesign)
- Offline maps (grid squares, distance visualization)
- Video tutorials & regional quick-start guides
