## Latest Release

**v1.4.0** — 2026-08-05

Live spots on the spectrum, and three long-standing causes of instability finally root-caused rather than patched around.

- **See who is on the air, on your own spectrum.** Park activations from **POTA** are drawn onto the trace at the frequency the station is actually using — bright callsign with a thin line down to the frequency scale, the way a FlexRadio shows them. **Grey means you have already worked that station on this band**, so you can see at a glance who you still need. **Press and drag** across the callsigns and lift your finger to pick one: the Tab5 tunes to it **and sets the mode**. Spots fade with age and disappear after 30 minutes, because a spot is a claim about *now*. Counts in the corners show how many more are just outside your window; tap one to go there. **RBN** (the CW skimmer network) can be added as a second source — off by default, since unlike POTA it is a continuous feed.
- **All internet uploads were broken — fixed.** QRZ, eQSL, LoTW *and* the update check were failing together on affected units: the encryption layer could not even start, because a hardware crypto engine was being starved of one specific kind of memory. If your uploads have been erroring, this is very likely why.
- **52 KB of memory recovered, and it explains a whole family of faults.** Found by measuring rather than guessing: the firmware's own tables were sitting in the one genuinely scarce pool. The free-memory low-water mark went from **0 KB to 32 KB**. That single cause covers the SD card refusing to remount, USB failing to re-open after a radio power-cycle, the upload failure above, and reboots after an hour of FT8 (Dennis WN4FLA).
- **Power-cycling the QMX recovers immediately.** Switching the radio off could leave the Tab5 pinning a CPU core on the dead USB connection — frozen screen, no recovery, reboot the only way out. Radio off → on now reconnects in a couple of seconds.
- **WiFi remembers your networks** (Roy KI0ER). Up to six, automatically, with nothing to fill in — every successful connection is remembered. If the network it is set to is not there, it finds a remembered one that is, within seconds. Picking a known network from **Scan** fills in its password.
- **Roy KI0ER's FT8 findings — four of five were real.** A partner still asking for your final gets it re-sent up to six times, and once that is used up the Tab5 **stays silent instead of calling CQ over him**. The occupancy strip no longer **fills up permanently** during a long CQ run. It now says **EVEN / ODD / BOTH**, so you know which time window you are looking at. And when hunting it gives the other time window a turn, keeping both halves of the band current.
- **The QRZ / eQSL / LoTW setup is no longer hidden** until you have logged a contact — backwards, since you want it set up *before* operating (Brian WA6JFK went through three browsers looking for it).

## Previous Releases

**v1.3.6** — 2026-08-03 — A pure fixes release, two of them closing problems as old as the project: the **"restart the QMX again and again" USB mystery solved** as two separate bugs (the Tab5-side one fixed with self-healing; the QMX-side one detected and explained on screen, reported to QRP Labs), a **crash on radio power-on** fixed (Dennis WN4FLA), **WiFi Scan working away from home**, **live TX status on the web page**, and the **"Diag(saved)" download delivering the crash log** with an SD card inserted.

**v1.3.5** — 2026-07-31 — Don WB0LQW's three requests, Roy KI0ER's bug report and the drawer touch fix: **CQ stops calling after a limit you set** (long-press Call CQ → **CQ stop**, never/1-5/10, live "call 2 of 4" counter, one extra listening slot after the final call), the **QSO log opens in your browser** (QSO Logs → View / edit log — sortable columns, per-row delete, type-DELETE Delete-all) with **Delete all on the Tab5 too** (two-tap, "ALL 34?"), an escape for the **busy-station hold** (TAP TO CANCEL), the **settings drawer stops stealing your finger** mid-drag, **QMX volume verified identical to the radio's own LCD** and capped at 50 dB (Randy N4OPI), and a latent bug fixed before it bit anyone: clearing the log would have silently disabled all future QRZ/eQSL/LoTW uploads.

**v1.3.4** — 2026-07-29 — The same-day field reports on v1.3.3, almost all from Roy KI0ER: a partner who never decoded your final now gets it **re-sent** (up to three times in four minutes) instead of the Tab5 moving on without ever making their log, finishing by hand no longer writes **duplicate log entries**, the fabricated `599` **signal reports nobody sent** are gone from the ADIF log, and the **occupancy map is filtered by time window** — a tone busy only in the opposite slot no longer reads as busy for you. The **TX frequency became a permanent button** on the FT8 screen with a **live mini occupancy strip** under the slot countdown, **TX Hold** (WSJT-X's "Hold Tx Freq") pins your tone, the parity choice is one cycling `TXCQ ANY / EVEN / ODD` button, and WiFi strength in the bottom bar is a **fan icon** with the freed width going to the network name.

**v1.3.3** — 2026-07-29 — Your TX audio frequency became visible and adjustable for the first time: a tone picker with a **live occupancy strip** across the 200-2800 Hz window, drag-to-pick, ±50 Hz, **Find clear slot**, changeable mid-QSO but never mid-burst (Roy KI0ER). The Tab5 also **stopped calling stations already working someone else** — which additionally stopped a merely-popular station being grey-listed for it — an incoming **`RRR`** began closing a QSO like `RR73` (it used to deadlock), a **QMX volume** slider in dB matching the radio's own LCD arrived for control-panel-less QMX+ builds (Randy N4OPI), and **LoTW uploads gained US state and county**, whose absence had been costing US operators their Worked All States and county credit (found via Paul N8HM's CardSat).

**v1.3.2** — 2026-07-26 — Grid squares are logged again (almost every QSO was missing `GRIDSQUARE` — John W5JSS), **PSK Reporter spotting** on by default (**since confirmed working**: "QMX Panadapter v1.3.2" is listed under "Software in use" at pskreporter.info with spots from six stations — note the 5½-minute delay before the first report, and that PSK Reporter never acknowledges anything, so that page is the only place to check), the **User Manual built into the firmware** so it needs no WiFi and no SD card and the "Save offline" button is gone, an explicit **microSD backup contract** (continuous with WiFi off and a green dot; one complete backup per start-up with WiFi on and a yellow dot — insert the card *before* switching on), **grey-listing** for stations that never answer (opt-in), and **pileup replies** using the intelligent-Transmit laddering (both Roy KI0ER).

**v1.3.1** — 2026-07-24 — Two decode-list columns requested by Roy KI0ER (**DT**, the station's slot-timing offset, and **HZ**, its audio tone, with the country column compacted to a 3-letter code), a boot-diagnostics fix so ST7121 units report the hardware actually detected (Paul VE3PIK), and UI alignment polish (QMX prompt placement, FT8 left-pane grid, settings-drawer dropdowns and sliders).

**v1.3.0** — 2026-07-23

Smarter manual FT8 operation — built around field feedback from **Roy KI0ER** — plus a rebuilt practice simulator, USB mouse support, and a web file browser for the microSD card.

- **Intelligent Transmit.** Tapping a decoded station's **Transmit** now sends the correct *next* message for that exchange — their CQ gets your grid (or your report with Skip-TX1 on), their grid gets your report, their report gets your roger, and so on — the same behaviour as a WSJT-X double-click. You can run a whole QSO by hand, one tap per step, and it **logs to ADIF** like any other contact when you send the closing RR73/73.
- **Faster replies.** The mid-slot reply window is wider and hand-armed exchanges now land on the beat instead of a cycle late. A subtle bug that made every exchange step transmit twice in some cases is fixed.
- **Fast pounce (early decode) — new toggle, on by default.** Decodes appear *before* the slot boundary (the way WSJT-X works), so answering a fresh CQ can transmit in the very next slot instead of waiting 30 s. ⚠️ *Honest note: this specific feature hasn't been verified on a live band yet (no antenna at the development QTH until mid-August). The known trade-off is that a station transmitting late in the slot can occasionally be missed. If your decode counts drop with it on, switch it off in the FT8 settings drawer — and please report your before/after numbers on the groups.io thread; that's exactly the field data we need.*
- **Pileup no longer hides the log.** While callers are waiting the ADIF-log button reads "Pileup" — **holding it now always opens the ADIF log** (a one-time hint teaches the gesture). **Auto-work pileup** also starts draining immediately when you enable it with callers already waiting, and worked-before stations only vanish from the pileup when you've actually checked "Exclude worked-before".
- **Practice simulator, rebuilt.** FT8 Simulation Mode now needs **no radio at all** — six phantom stations (US + DX) call CQ, four of them answer your CQ at once (a real pileup to practice on), and they're patient like real operators: each repeats its message up to four times before giving up. They answer manual step-by-step Transmit, Auto Pounce, and CQ-runs alike. When you're done, a **"Del N test"** button in the ADIF viewer (only visible while practice contacts exist) wipes them from the log in two taps.
- **USB mouse.** Plug a mouse into the USB-A port — a cursor appears and clicks drive everything. *(Limitation: the mouse and QMX can't share the port, and a USB hub can't bridge them on this hardware — so it's for setup, log review and manual reading with the radio unplugged.)*
- **microSD file browser.** **Files → SD Files** in the web page opens a browser for the card — download logs and backups, upload, delete — without pulling the card out.
- **User Manual on a fresh boot** now waits for WiFi instead of asking for a reboot.

**v1.2.0** — 2026-07-20 — A built-in **User Manual on the Tab5 itself** (Settings drawer → User Manual): native markdown reader with a drag-to-pick two-column Contents page, offline copies to microSD (**Save offline**), and a quiet GitHub firmware-update check. *(The Save-offline mechanism was superseded in v1.3.2 — the manual now ships inside the firmware.)* Plus the FT8 pileup fix: a worked (or late-answering) station no longer lingers in the pileup. *(Thanks to Dirk DK7CVD.)*

**v1.1.0** — 2026-07-19 — A years-old FT8 decode mystery solved: the panadapter used to hear 60+ stations in its first slots then collapse to a fraction; the cause was ~200–350 ms of QMX audio lost at the USB wire every slot (invisible to every counter). Fixed — full decode rate every slot now. Plus the microSD card promoted to a full grab-and-go station backup (QSO log + settings + LoTW cert/key), automatic GPS time sync (~10 ms, no toggle), a band-plan drag from the bottom bar, and an ADIF-viewer crash fix.

**v1.0.1** — 2026-07-17 — Point fix: when you answer a CQ, the report you send back is your own measurement of their signal, not an echo of theirs. (Reported by Steve N0SZ, Jonathan KN6LFB.)

### v1.0.0 — 2026-07-16

**The 1.0.** The beta label is gone: the QMX Panadapter is a complete, self-contained FT8/FT4 station — receive, transmit, auto-QSO, logging, and upload to **all three major logbooks** — with no PC anywhere in the loop.

- **LoTW upload — the final piece.** QSOs are signed on the device with your own ARRL callsign certificate and uploaded directly to Logbook of the World. One-time guided setup from the web page (step-by-step TQSL certificate export, then import — your certificate passphrase never leaves your browser). Live-verified against lotw.arrl.org. Certificate renewal: Ctrl-click the LoTW button
- **The FT8 "everything sent twice" behaviour is fixed.** Replies used to miss their own slot by ~2 seconds and go out again next cycle, doubling QSO duration; the transmitter now holds ~2 seconds for the fresh reply and fires it on the same slot. Field-verified on air
- **Nonstandard callsigns work now**: special/compound calls (special-event stations, `PJ4/...`) no longer show as `<...>` once heard in full, and their answers to your CQ are recognized
- **Correct received reports in the log**: the partner's `R-06`-style roger is their real measurement of your signal and is now logged as such — no more 599 placeholders from CQ runs. (Old 599 rows can be deleted — see next)
- **QSO log viewer grows up**: a Today/All filter with a **POTA activation counter** (title turns green at 10 QSOs today), and **single-record delete** — long-press a row, drag to the right line, release, confirm. Deletions keep all three logbook upload positions consistent
- **Broken QSOs resume**: if a station fades mid-exchange and comes back within a few minutes, the exchange continues where it stopped (automatically, or by tapping their row) instead of restarting from scratch
- **Steadier decode list during CQ runs**: stations you can't currently hear (they transmit when you do) no longer vanish mid-run, and the list keeps entries for 2 minutes instead of 1
- **Display sleep**: set an idle timeout and the screen turns off while everything keeps running (FT8, radio link, web UI). Tap to wake — the wake tap can't press anything. Two-finger double-tap blanks immediately. A real battery win for unattended and web-only use
- **Reorganized settings drawer**: setup items (WiFi, callsign, band-plan region, brightness, battery care, display sleep) grouped at the top, display-tuning controls below
- **Web page polish**: the bottom bar's many buttons are now three tidy menus (QSO Logs / Files / Miscellaneous); a congested WiFi link can no longer freeze the page for seconds
- **A rare crash fixed**: a momentary USB glitch on the radio-control link could reboot the whole device; it now just retries
- Full writeup in [Version History Document](https://github.com/SteffenLav/qmx-panadapter/blob/main/docs/version-history.md)

### v0.21.0

- **FT4 returned** — the panadapter no longer redraws itself behind the FT8/FT4 screen, freeing the processor headroom FT4's 7.5-second cadence needs; verified end-to-end (RX + TX)
- Fixed a full-screen display flash (mostly in FT4); QRZ upload no longer gets stuck on already-logged contacts; reset settings or Wi-Fi from the web page; QMX VOX switched off automatically at link time

### v0.20.1 / v0.20.0

- **Robustness release.** WiFi "dies after a few minutes" fault now self-heals instead of needing a reboot; opening a window no longer freezes the device; the radio-control (CAT) link rides out USB glitches; the web UI pauses its stream while FT8 runs
- FT8 decode timing anchored to the exact slot boundary; FT8 pile-up list + "Skip TX1" quick pounce; 11 m/CB band; memory-channel overhaul; battery-care charge limit; web-UI whole-band plan strip, draggable split, better screenshots and keypad
- microSD now on its own bus (SD auto-archive still off — it squeezed memory needed by FT8)
- v0.20.1 hot-fix: fixed a reboot on every pounce (a scratch table overflowed a small task stack; moved to PSRAM)
- *(FT4 was switched off across v0.20.x for the memory pressure now resolved in v0.21.0.)*

### v0.19.5

- AM mode + Antenna Tune for QMX 1_04+ firmware (invisible on stable 1_03_002)
- Fixed a crash on leaving FT8 mode; WiFi on/off now applies live and no longer wipes a saved password; FT8/FT4 remembers its own frequency
- Band picker shows all bands in two columns; band-plan strip is a see-through framed window with 6 m segments; steadier point-to-tune; settings-drawer slider/scroll fixes; DiGi-gated memory recall in FT8/FT4

### v0.19.4

- FT4 usability — four stacked faults fixed: a capture buffer's FFT workspace in slow memory (every other slot decoded nothing), a mis-firing stuck-decoder watchdog wiping the list mid-QSO, an uncapped per-slot clock nudge, and slot-parity computed on FT8's grid in FT4
- QMX IQ-mode confirmation hardened (readback no longer fooled by the command echo)
- See-through frequency keypad; settings-drawer declutter (removed Snap-to-signal + FT8 sync lines, moved Band-plan region)

### v0.19.3

- QMX IQ-mode handshake retried automatically (up to 4 attempts), with a red on-screen banner if all attempts fail — a silent failure could leave a whole session without I/Q data (spectrum shifted, tunable across the full 48 kHz window)
- Band-plan strip: tracks zoom/pan live, shows the filter passband at band scale, drag-to-tune and tap-to-jump directly on the strip
- Memory channel drag-to-move; tap an empty slot to create; out-of-band frequencies rejected immediately
- Frequency entry popup: draggable, resizable (pinch/swipe), position remembered across reboots
- ADIF log viewer rebuilt: real column alignment, sticky header, Country and Mode columns, Sent/Rcvd split, zebra rows
- FT8/FT4 TX confirm dialog: up/down nudge buttons; FT4 countdown and title corrected for 7.5-second slots
- FT4 clock-sync fix (timing offset was using FT8's block geometry, ~3.3× wrong) and FT4 decode-quality fix (FT8's iteration cut no longer applied to FT4)
- QRZ/eQSL uploads more reliable (SD auto-archive paused during uploads); web UI stale-connection freeze capped at 5 s

### v0.19.2

- microSD auto-archive: diagnostic log, ADIF log, and a config export are mirrored automatically to a microSD card when one is inserted
- Diagnostic log is now always-on and survives a power loss (a rolling copy persists to internal flash, downloadable even with no SD card)
- USB reconnect fix: power-cycling the QMX after WiFi is up no longer breaks audio/CAT
- Crash fix: a USB disconnect race that could reboot the Tab5 when the QMX dropped off USB
- QMX IQ mode is now verified, not assumed — the panadapter checks the radio actually accepted the I/Q-mode command instead of just checking the USB write succeeded
- FT8 continuation messages (report, RR73, 73) resend less often during an active QSO — decode time on busy slots cut by ~25-30%

### v0.19.1

- New project homepage at [tab5.lav.dk](https://tab5.lav.dk) — the user guide and reference as plain web pages
- Logbook uploads (QRZ / eQSL) and log downloads now work reliably while FT8 is running — no more reboots or dropped WiFi during a transfer

### v0.19.0

- FT4 transmit and receive (7.5-second slots, 105 symbols, 48 ms cadence) — CAT cadence verified on real QMX hardware
- Per-mode sticky frequency/bandwidth/filter recall between FT8 and FT4

### v0.18.8

- ARRL Field Day FT8 exchange mode (class + section in message, special TX sequence, ADIF logging)
- FT8 simulation mode (practice QSOs with phantom stations, no radio keyed)
- FT8 decode yield investigation closed (found and fixed 3 separate CPU contention issues)

### v0.18.7

- Decode-yield gap **closed** (controlled A/B with v0.18.0 confirmed fixes sufficient)
- Auto-answer robot mode un-shelved (live TX, full disclaimer on-screen)
- CQ tone auto-relocation on clash
- SNTP/QMX time-priority fix + FT8-derived auto-sync
- Flasher recovery mode + auto port detection

### v0.18.6

- FT8 sparse-decode investigation: found 3 separate regressions since v0.18.0
- Fixed: `cw_audio_init()` ghost task, missing poll-task CDC tolerance, waterfall style-set loop
- RST_SENT fix in CQ-run QSO
- Distance-in-miles display toggle
- Diag-log dot + firmware version in bottom bar

### v0.18.5

- Band-aid for FT8 decode regression (incomplete; issue fully addressed in v0.18.6)
- Critical bootloader-corruption hotfix (flasher wrote to 0x0 instead of 0x10000)
- FT8 double-spawn crash guard restored

### v0.18.4

- Band-nav strip (CW/Digi/Phone color zones below frequency axis)
- One-finger pan/stroll (spectrum scroll + center-freq readout)
- Snap-to-signal peak detection
- Band-aware worked-before (callsign + band memory)
- Robot mode (complete but **shelved** — greyed out, disabled)

### v0.18.3

- Waterfall live controls (black level, contrast, adaptive floor, FFT window selector)
- Display 180° flip toggle
- Image rejection investigation (reverted — not a firmware issue)

### v0.18.2

- Idle reboot resolved (WiFi SDIO RX streaming → mempool recycled buffer)
- Web UI freeze/reconnect fix
- BW from web (CW passband)

### v0.18.1

- Config backup/restore (settings + memory channels + ADIF log as INI file)
- Flasher clean-flash option
- Memory recall fix (CAT race condition → optimistic display + deferred writes)
- Fast Panadapter↔FT8 toggle crash fix

### v0.18.0

- FT8 decode rework: streaming STFT + dual-core + reply-on-immediate-slot
- dBm scale restored on spectrum
- Multiple field-reported fixes (memory freq, tap-to-tune reversal, band lockout)

### v0.15.x and Earlier

See [Full Version History](https://github.com/SteffenLav/qmx-panadapter/blob/main/docs/version-history.md) for detailed notes on all earlier releases.

## Roadmap

### Next up (post-v1.0.0)

1. **Web-UI audio streaming** — listen to the receiver in any browser on your LAN, demodulated on the Tab5. Already working in development; held for quality tuning and an overnight streaming soak
2. **CW page** — canned-message CW TX memories, then decoded-CW display
3. **Live microSD mirroring while WiFi is up** — continuous mirroring currently only runs with WiFi off; v1.3.2 made that explicit and reliable (one complete backup per start-up with WiFi on). This was believed to be bus contention between the card and the WiFi co-processor. v1.4.0 found that a large part of it was actually a memory shortage — the pool the card needs to mount had been squeezed to almost nothing, and now has room again — so this may already behave better than documented. Needs a retest before the behaviour is changed

### Phase 6.3 (FPS Recovery)

- Native portrait LVGL rewrite (720×1280, all widgets transposed, canvas drawing ported)
- Avoids 90° software rotation (~50% FPS gain)
- Large effort; not yet started

### Future Additions

- CW audio (shelved since v0.18.5 due to CPU contention; needs pipeline redesign)
- Offline maps (grid squares, distance visualization)
- Video tutorials & regional quick-start guides
